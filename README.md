## About Dataset
### Context
The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness . The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.

### Content
The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll . The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.

# Conclusions

We see that there are many clear distinctions between happy and unhappy countries - at least at the extremes. 

Generally, happier countries tend to:

- be wealthier

- be less populous

- have fewer children

- be older

- be less corrupt

- be more free

- have a lot of social support

Of course, a lot of these findings may come **as a result of** being wealthy, rather than be a cause of happiness in and of themselves.

We also know that, generally, the happy stay happy, and the unhappy are getting unhappier. 

However, as we have seen with Bulgaria - this does not have to be the case. Bulgaria improved by over 1.5 points between 2007 and 2020 - the most of any country. So there is hope that unhappy countries can break the historic trends.
